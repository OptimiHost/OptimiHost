# Oh, That's Bad

**Recently, an outage regarding OptimiHost has took down everything.** 

>>>

To be fair we use Hetzner as a cloud computing service. What does this mean, though? Hetzner uses a detection system called ASS (I'd prefer to call it HASS) which takes security actions based on what happened. Somehow, through our CDN (which transports Player2 AppImages), a hacker ran a netscan spam. This triggered the ASS, which got OptimiDev's IP banned and got we got a message from the federal office. This got us in a bunch of legal trouble. 
Optimi has been able to fix these issues, and eventually, the dashboard is now up. 
optimihost.com, however, is down. It is just a redirector to the dashboard. The website in general is not up. 
As thesomewhatyou, I got fired and shortly rehired. All issues that have been broken are resolved. 
optimihost.com will recover shortly.
